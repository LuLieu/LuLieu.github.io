    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
    <section>
        <h3>Bad Website: <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com">Berkshire Hathaway</a></h3>
        <p>Berkshire Hathaway is a holdings conglomerate based out of Omaha, Nebraska. Here's where it falls short:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Contrast:</strong> While there isn't any insane contrasting issues, some text is so small that it almost blends into the white background.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Repetition:</strong> Every link looks the same, as if half of this site was carbon-copied to the other half. Symmetric, but bad.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything is centered (minus the bullet points) until you enter the footer, where it is all left aligned.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Proximity:</strong> There is so much white space that everything feels far apart.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Overall, I would like to know how much this conglomerate paid someone to make this website. It's that... interesting.

        <h3>Good Website: <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com">Best Buy</a></h3>
        <p>Best Buy is an online/physical department store with all of your technological needs. Here's whats good about it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Contrast:</strong> Very good contrasting. You can clearly read text and everything is straight-forward
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Repetition:</strong> The main page of Best Buy is super non-repetitive, with all boxes of your favorite items popping up to catch your interest.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Alignment:</strong> Content is aligned and stays within equal margins.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Proximity:</strong> Clickable items have ample whitespace between them for reading and clicking, with little room for error.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>Overall, very uniquely designed website. Best Buy has always been a good website to interact with and is fun for the eyes.</p>
