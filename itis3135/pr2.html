<h3>Your submission leads right to the page to be reviewed (or if instructed the primary page with links to the page, or both)✅</h3>

<h3>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names, including scripts, images, etc.⛔</h3>
    <p>- index.html picture has a complex name, homepic.png or something like that would work just fine!</p>


<h3>Design</h3>
<p>
    a. Page has sufficient contrast/font sizing so as to be easy to read✅
    b. Page has site colors and fonts using the standard .css file, unless this assignment requires a unique/standalone/embedded one✅
    c. CRAP:
    i. Contrast✅
    ii. Repetition✅
    iii. Alignment✅
    iv. Proximity✅
</p>

<h3>Page has within it:</h3>
<p>
    a. Header✅
    b. Main✅
    c. Footer✅
    d. (optional) nav for main menu between header and main✅
</p>


<h3>Header has site/brand header with text in an h1✅</h3>

<h3>Main starts with name of page as an h2 and does not include name of site/brand⛔</h3>
<p>Donations and Volunteer page do not have a matching h2 to head the page.</p>

<h3>Page has brand tagline somewhere (make up a slogan and include it on every page in a consistent location)✅</h3>

<h3>Page has footer with✅:</h3>
<p>
    a. Menu for client page-related links⛔
     <strong>- Footer contains links to class-related pages.</strong>
    b. Page has accumulus✅
</p>

<h3>Overall thoughts:</h3>
<p>Everything looks generally pretty good! There are some minor grammatical mistakes such as "physical Therapy" on the programs page
    and there should be use of figures and figcaptions for the images. Nice work :D
