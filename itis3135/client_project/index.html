    <h3>Why We're Here</h3>
    <p>It's an unfortunate truth that many people are unsafe in their current or past relationships. When our <a href="about.html">founder</a> sought
    out community after complications with her past relationships that affected her every day life and well-being, she decided to create a safe space
  that allows all students to learn, heal, and spread awareness on the signs of sexual assault in your own or others' relationships.</p>
  <p>At VOICE, we aim to offer a sense of community and <a href="resources.html">resources</a> to those in need. Find out how you can help today!</p>
