            <h2>What is Competitive Marvel Rivals?</h2>
            <p>Competitive Marvel Rivals is a subcategory of Marvel Rivals players who compete against each other for money <em>($14,500)</em>, in-game items,
                 or just bragging rights. The competitive scene is popular among collegiates as universities often brawl against each other for prizes.</p>

            <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
            <p>If you, like many, are seeking refuge from the horrors that is Overwatch 2, Marvel Rivals is the perfect video game for you. 
                It combines all of your favorite MCU characters into a fun team-based hero combat game. However, many choose to take their
                gaming experience to the next level by entering <strong>competitive</strong> gamemodes and fighting to be the best.
            </p>
            <p>Below is my own Marvel Rivals stats page. Here, you can see a breakdown of my in-game
                statistics, as well as my career highest rank. To see how ranks are divided, visit the <a href="#how">How</a> section.

            <p>About every 2 months, the developers of Marvel Rivals will push an update that contains
                a multitude of changes and additions to maintain gamer interests. With these updates, all player's ranks will be
                reduced by a constant amount and they will have to rebuild their ranks over the course of the new season.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point in the season, these are the top 9 players. Every player can see them in this leaderboard tab
                as this displays the competitive player's dedication to the game.

            <h2>Where do these events take place?</h2>
            <p>Since the pandemic, gaming tournaments have taken a turn toward being online rather than a local area network (LAN). 
                This would mean that players could play from the comfort of their own home offices to compete in competitive
                tournaments. Before the pandemic (and once again rising in popularity), competitive LAN environments were the arena of choice.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p><em>"can you make me an image of a LAN gaming arena"</em></p>
            <p>The image displayed above is a brief recreation of what a LAN party would look like. Team members are lined up next to each other
                and are typically playing back to back to avoid any unfair advantages.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="why">
            <h2>Why does competitiveness matter?</h2>
            <p>People are driven to competitive environments for many reasons. It could be because of the $14,500 prize pool, or as simple as the Invisible Woman
                recolor skin. I personally like the adrenaline rush of getting into good fights and being rewarded for exceptional teamwork and communication.
            </p>
            <p>Those who play for their college e-Sports teams may also be eligible for benefits.
                Players may be recognized by official gaming teams and associations, allowing them
                to have access to paid contracts, free housing, and sometimes, tuition reimbursement. Otherwise, scholarships are popular outcomes of collegiate teams
                excelling in their field, and this is no different for Marvel Rivals.

            <p>Above are the rewards for the base competitive gamemode in Marvel Rivals. By achieving a certain season peak, you will
                recieve those rewards at the end of the season. These rewards have been a point of controversy among the community, as
                many players think their hard work and dedication is worth more than a recolor of a base skin. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This has really only been a problem in Overwatch, however. Since Marvel Rivals' release in December 2024, Overwatch 2 has upped their
                game when it comes to free rewards.
